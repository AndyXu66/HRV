# HRV
## Overview
This tool is designed to compare remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signal output with ground truth PPG signal from a text file. The tool reads the two signals, computes the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM), and visualizes the signals with detected peaks, making it easy to evaluate the model's performance.
## Purpose
+ Input:
  ++ An rPPG signal text file (model output)
  ++ A ground truth PPG signal text file
